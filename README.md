# chatGPT ShinyApp
ChatGPT ShinyApp is an R Shiny application that allows users to interact with GPT-3, a language processing AI model. It utilizes the {gptchatteR} package, which was created by [Isin Altinkaya](https://github.com/isinaltinkaya) and can be found at https://github.com/isinaltinkaya/gptchatteR

## Features
On the left side of the app, there is a text area where users can input their prompts. Once a prompt is submitted, the app will display a table with the prompt and the corresponding response generated by GPT-3. Users have the ability to select and delete rows from the table at any time.

The table can display HTML content, and several buttons are included to allow users to export, copy, and print the table.
